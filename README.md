# The purpose of this project is to build a decentralized To-Do List using a smart contract written in Solidity.

# This contract allows users to:
- Add tasks with descriptions.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- View the list of all tasks.

By storing tasks on the blockchain, we ensure transparency, immutability, and decentralized access, which are core principles of Web3 applications.

## 
# Features
- Task Creation | Users can add a new task with a description
- Task Completion | Users can mark a task as completed.
- View all tasks | Anyone can retrieve the entire list of tasks.
- Event logging | Logs actions like task creation and completion for external liserners (frontend, DApps)
